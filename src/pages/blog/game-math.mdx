import Latex from "../../components/Latex.astro";

A practical reference for the math needed for game development.
Some basic knowledge (e.g., basic algebra, familiarity with Cartesian coordinates) is assumed.

<div class="flexbox-vertical note">
I learned much of the info here from <a class="text-link" href="https://gamemath.com/" target="_blank">
_3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development_</a> by Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parbery.
It’s an engagingly written, accessible, and—most importantly—free online textbook about game math.
Check it out if you want to see more detailed explanations or proofs of the concepts outlined below.

## Mathematical Notation

### Summation Notation

Summation notation (also called “sigma notation” after the uppercase Greek letter) represents the sum of the elements of a sequence. It resembles a `for` loop in programming.

<Latex formula="{\sum _{i\mathop {=} m}^{n}a_{i}=a_{m}+a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\cdots +a_{n-1}+a_{n}}" />

Example:

<Latex formula="{\sum _{i=3}^{5}i^{2}=3^{2}+4^{2}+5^{2}=50}" />

### Product Notation

Product notation (also called “pi notation” after the uppercase Greek letter) represents the product of the elements of a sequence.

<Latex formula="{\prod _{i=m}^{n}x_{i}=x_{m}\cdot x_{m+1}\cdot x_{m+2}\cdot \,\,\cdots \,\,\cdot x_{n-1}\cdot x_{n}}" />

Example:

<Latex formula="{\prod _{i=1}^{3}(i+1)=(1+1)\,(2+1)\,(3+1)=24}" />

### Interval Notation

In interval notation, a square bracket denotes inclusivity (a “closed interval”), while a parethesis denotes exclusivity (an “open interval”).

Example:

<Latex formula="\mathrm{[-3, 5)}\textrm{ is equivalent to }\mathrm{-3 \leq x < 5}" />

## Trigonometry

TODO

## Vectors

A location in coordinate space is represented with an ordered pair such as:

<Latex formula="(1, 2)\\(1, 2, 3)" />

### Types of 3D Coordinate Spaces

A three-dimensional coordinate space can be “left-handed” or “right-handed.”
These are distinct types because they cannot be rotated to align with each other
(although a 3D space can be transformed from one type to the other by flipping one of its axes).
In contrast, all two-dimensional coordinate spaces can be rotated to align.

You can use your hands to figure out the handedness of a 3D coordinate space:
Form an “L” with your thumb and index finger. Your thumb represents the x-axis,
and your index finger represents the y-axis (both pointing in the positive direction).
Extend your middle finger so it’s perpendicular to the other two fingers.
Your middle finger represents the z-axis pointing in the positive direction.

<div class="flexbox-vertical note">
**Unreal Engine** uses a left-handed coordinate system with the z-axis pointing upward and the x-axis pointing forward.
**Maya** uses a right-handed coordinate system with the y-axis pointing upward and the z-axis pointing forward.
</div>

To find the direction of positive rotation in a left-handed coordinate system, use the “left-hand rule”
(conversely, use the “right-hand rule” for a right-handed coordinate system):
Place your hand into a “thumbs up” position. Your extended thumb represents the axis of rotation
pointing in the positive direction. The direction your other fingers are curled is the direction of positive rotation.

### Dot Product

<Latex formula="{\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {b} \right\|\cos \theta}" />

### Cross Product

<Latex formula="{\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} =\|\mathbf {a} \|\|\mathbf {b} \|\sin(\theta )\,\mathbf {n}}" />

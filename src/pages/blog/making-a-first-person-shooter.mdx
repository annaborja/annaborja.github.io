A detailed overview of the aspects that need to be considered when implementing an FPS game.

## The Character Mesh

### Traditional First-Person Versus True First-Person

A fundamental question is: Do you want the player to be able to see their character’s body when they look down? If not, you can essentially attach an arms-only skeletal mesh to the first-person camera and call it a day.
If you want the player to be able to see their body, then there are two main strategies:

  - Use a first-person (arms-only) mesh and combine it on the character
    with a separate third-person (full-body) mesh that has the upper-body bones hidden.
    - This strategy offers you fine-grained control over the placement and animations of each mesh,
      allowing you to tailor them specifically for the first-person view.
  - ”True first-person”: Use a single skeletal mesh for the upper and lower body
    but hide various bones (like the head and neck) to prevent the camera from clipping into the mesh
    (since the first-person camera will be positioned at the mesh’s head).
    - This strategy can offer a great sense of realism and efficiency
      in that first-person and third-person views can share the same mesh and animations.
      However, this same efficiency leads to less control in terms of how you tailor your animations for first-person view.
    - Your camera is also at the mercy of your animations if it is attached to your skeletal mesh’s head bone,
      and you’ll need to be careful to avoid causing motion sickness for your players.

Allowing the player to see their own body can heighten the player’s sense of immersion but at the cost of adding complexity to the game’s implementation:
  - You need to position the body mesh in a way that looks natural from any angle the player may be looking from.
  - You need to prevent the camera from ever clipping into the body mesh.
  - Animations for the lower body need to look natural, taking into consideration
    all the different angles the player could be looking from and all the different movements
    they could be executing at any one time (idling, running, strafing, jumping, landing, attacking, etc.).
  - Lower-body animations need to stay in sync with those of the upper body.
  - The lower-body mesh must not excessively obstruct the player’s view
    (especially if the player is ever expected to be shooting downward from the air).

### Multiplayer Considerations

If your player character utilizes a first-person (arms-only) mesh, then you’ll need to display a separate third-person mesh
to other players in a multiplayer scenario. The first-person mesh should be visible only to the player,
while the third-person mesh should be visible only to other players.

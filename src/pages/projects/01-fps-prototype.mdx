## Overview

Inspired by the story-driven campaigns of games like _Titanfall 2_ and _Uncharted_, the weapon systems of games like _Halo_ and _Call of Duty_, and the companion mechanics of games like _Mass Effect_ and _Gears of War_, I created this project to practice the design and implementation of various interconnecting game systems and mechanics.

## Controls

Using Unreal Engine’s **Enhanced Input** system, the game’s controls are implemented for both gamepads and mouse/keyboard.

In designing this control scheme, my goal was to support a **wide variety of actions** while keeping the controls as **simple and intuitive** as possible. Tap/hold triggers allow a single button to support multiple actions in a way that’s intended to be easy for the player to remember and execute. For accessibility purposes, the hold time threshold for these controls could be made customizable by the player.

### Gamepad Controls

</div>

## Camera

Although the game is designed to be an FPS, I wanted to practice working with different camera systems, so I implemented a camera that can switch between **first-person and third-person (over-the-shoulder) modes**.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vuDTP0blgtA?si=jrElcXxS3jBrVRyH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To support multiple camera perspectives, I used separate first-person (“arms only”) and third-person skeletal meshes for each playable character. I shared animations between these meshes by creating an **IK Retargeter** for each unique skeleton in Unreal Engine and retargeting animations between them.

<img alt="A screenshot of an IK Retargeter in Unreal Engine showcasing two different skeletal meshes arranged in similar T-poses." src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/ik-retargeting.png" width="700" />

I used a variety of techniques inside an **Animation Blueprint** to implement smooth animation transitions for each skeleton, including animation state machines, blended poses, Blend Spaces, and Aim Offsets.

</div>

## Gameplay Abilities

Most significant actions in the game are implemented using Unreal Engine’s **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**. Using GAS allowed me to not only tap into a robust system of activation, blocking, and cancellation capabilities, but to do so in a clean and organized way.

### Sprinting

I integrated GAS cost and cooldown capabilities with sprinting to build a **stamina regeneration** mechanic. The amount of stamina a character has, how quickly it is depleted by actions like sprinting, and the rate at which it regenerates can all be configured through **gameplay attributes**.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kXXaiM-HnN8?si=DCpwGBlKH47MJQLM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<img alt="An animated GIF of a video game stamina bar emptying and refilling" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/stamina-bar.gif" />

### Aim Down Sights (ADS)

When aiming down sights, the player’s crosshair gets tighter to indicate reduced bullet spread. The camera smoothly interpolates to a narrower field of view, and the player’s camera speed slows down to facilitate more accurate targeting.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MhAoixCCYHE?si=oXEdrlvFWA40kYkU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Reloading

When a character reloads, a reloading Animation Montage is played. The underlying Animation Sequence triggers cosmetic effects like sound cues (SFX) and particle systems (VFX). As the montage finishes, a set of ammo-related **gameplay attributes** is calculated and updated, which is immediately reflected in the player’s HUD.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KYejliLJBoc?si=FAI47keQAIxPihMZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<img alt="An animated GIF of a video game HUD element tracking ammo as a weapon is fired and reloaded" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/ammo-display.gif" />

### Weapon Switching

Each character can carry two weapons at a time. When switching weapons, a section of an Animation Montage is played based on the weapon types the character is transitioning between (one-handed to two-handed weapon or vice versa).

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C0sPY62bEMQ?si=PA17Y_CVtRNfXSv7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Character Switching

In this prototype, I wanted to be able to play with a variety of character types and weapons, so I implemented a system in which **every companion is also a playable character**.

When the player switches between characters, the screen briefly fades to white and a Sound Cue plays to indicate the transition. Under the hood, C++ code executes teardown logic on the departing character to prepare it for AI control (switching from a first-person mesh to a third-person mesh, starting Behavior Tree logic, etc.). Similarly, setup logic is executed on the incoming character to prep it for player control.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EPM5ToOgwuY?si=0uZM1Pk5JHfHXpgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OQCuxjuklA?si=Qb_m_Hx92DDq6zrg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Melee Attacks

During a melee attack, an Animation Montage is played, which triggers a Notify State that creates and then destroys a **hitbox**. Hostile characters that overlap with this hitbox play a hit reaction animation and are dealt damage.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UXpClSRNHYI?si=VSewBn8DtX6nJqRM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Since shooting is the main form of combat in this prototype, I kept the melee system simple. In a more complex melee combat system, unique attacks could be designed to use hitboxes of different sizes, shapes, and placements. Systems like soft locking could also be implemented using **motion warping** to aid the player’s accuracy.

### Special Abilities

Although they aren’t fully fleshed out yet, I implemented a few different special abilities as a proof of concept. Special abilities can add **variety and depth** to combat by giving the player options other than just shooting.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d6ZEroUDTY4?si=qUMLQHRtnq90VODU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Shooting

The three types of guns in this prototype—pistols, assault rifles, and shotguns—are implemented as **hitscan** weapons.

Shooting is implemented as a GAS **gameplay ability**. The ability code performs various line traces and calculations to execute each shot along with triggering relevant animations, SFX, VFX, hit reactions, and damage gameplay effects. It utilizes GAS costs to consume weapon ammo and GAS cooldowns to enforce a maximum rate of fire.

### Spread

To implement spread, a bullet’s trajectory is **randomized within a cone originating from the gun’s muzzle**. The cone’s diameter could be calculated using gameplay attributes and other flags, such as whether the character is running or standing still. This would allow for combat variability based on weapon stats, character stats, and player behaviors.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/901ZnP6ThOo?si=1N8pu6mvnlg6aDi-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Weapons like shotguns can be configured to fire multiple projectiles at once.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GSXEUZaGKk?si=UAJ1poWcnYWlD4IY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Recoil

After firing a weapon, **viewkick** is temporarily added to the viewport to simulate recoil. The direction and severity at which viewkick affects the camera’s pitch and yaw—as well as the rate of viewkick recovery (**centerspeed**)—could be configured for each unique weapon, allowing for a variety of differentiated weapon designs.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xfok9wym4Wc?si=K159YaAeZSz_L5R7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Aim Assist

To assist the player’s targeting accuracy, the camera movement speed slows down slightly when the player’s reticle is near or on top of a hostile target.

## Scripting

I implemented a system that allows me to trigger scripted events within a level in a data-driven way.

<img alt="A screenshot of an Unreal Engine Data Table filled with scripted events" class="flex-grow-1" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/scripting-data-table.png" />

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7qFSqtya-90?si=qbDhqvzfr5bLSQfr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**NPC barks** can be triggered, which utilize **Dialogue Waves** to play audio (in this prototype, placeholder audio is used in lieu of recorded dialogue). Subtitles are displayed in the HUD for accessibility. Barks can trigger other barks, allowing NPCs to respond to each other.

<img alt="An animated GIF of video game dialogue subtitles" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/barks-1.gif" />

Scripted behaviors for NPCs can be triggered, such as gesture animations and targeted movement.

<div class="flexbox-horizontal flexbox-horizontal-blocks">
  <img alt="An animated GIF of a video game character turning and pointing in the distance" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/scripted-turn.gif" />

  <img alt="An animated GIF of a video game character nodding" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/scripted-nod.gif" />
</div>

**Mission objectives and tutorials** can be triggered and displayed in the HUD.

<img alt="An animated GIF of a video game tutorial notification being shown and then hidden" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/scripted-tutorial.gif" />

<img alt="An animated GIF of a video game mission objective notification being shown and then hidden" src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/scripted-objective.gif" />

Temporary player view targets can be triggered (wherein the player is prompted to press a button to pan the camera in a certain direction and gain visual context on their objective).

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CGZlfKYYqhI?si=hNpzgo2Xz8y13jDw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Companion AI

Companion logic is implemented in a **Behavior Tree**.

Companions can be targeted at a particular location, encouraging the player to follow them.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zb8uyFebxm0?si=lwLWdDweA780DcgF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When not in combat and not targeted at a location, companions will generally follow the player.

**Nav Link Proxies** are used to bridge separated areas within the level’s **Navigation Mesh**. Companions will use these links to follow the player, performing relevant movements like opening doors and mantling onto objects along the way.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZPZP2ngfJ4?si=tBUMk8BQXRZ_nfns" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To avoid impeding the player’s movement, companions will move out of the way if the player bumps into them. This behavior uses **Environment Query System (EQS)** queries to find a reasonable nearby location for the NPC to go.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/as1_ba3wwaM?si=eLCEgWn5NF-Bqw4T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Enemy AI

Enemy logic is implemented in a **Behavior Tree**.

Enemies not engaged in combat can be posted at a particular location or walk along a patrol route.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/neZsZaLwJV4?si=bv-NkS6qhiBp4xEd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Through an **AI Perception Component**, enemies can detect when the player is nearby. When the player first enters an enemy’s sight line, the enemy turns toward the player and plays an audio bark to indicate that the player has been spotted. If other enemies are nearby, they will also be alerted to the player’s presence (this is accomplished through an **instance synced Blackboard key** that is shared across related enemies).

Basic enemy combat behavior is implemented using **Environment Query System (EQS)** queries. Enemies attack the nearest player or companion while maintaining a minimum distance and preferring to attack from behind cover. Enemies will also switch between weapons depending on their distance from their target.

<iframe class="yt-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R_Aed4SPZTA?si=Hvz8XZlvJLOVhs-J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## UI

The persistent HUD displays several key pieces of information related to the player’s vital stats, squad, weapons, and special abilities. These UI components dynamically update as the relevant stats and information change.

[PIC TODO]

Thanks to Unreal Engine’s **Common UI** plugin, the game’s UI can dynamically support gamepad and mouse/keyboard icons depending on what type of controller the player is using.

[VIDEO TODO]

The game’s main menu supports three levels of tabbing. Under the hood, it utilizes Common UI widgets like tab lists, carousels, and activatable widget switchers.

[VIDEO TODO]

The HUD can display temporary UI components like notifications, input prompts, and info displays. Under the hood, these components use fade animations and C++ timers to display information at the right time.

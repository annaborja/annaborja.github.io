  # Asset Credits

  To speed up development and allow myself to focus on design and coding, I utilized premade assets from these sources:
  
  - TODO

## Overview

Inspired by the story-driven campaigns of games like _Titanfall 2_ and _Uncharted_, the weapon systems of games like _Halo_ and _Call of Duty_, and the companion mechanics of games like _Mass Effect_ and _Gears of War_, I created this project to practice the design and implementation of various interconnecting game systems and mechanics.

## Controls

Using Unreal Engine 5’s **Enhanced Input** system, I implemented the game’s controls for both gamepads and mouse/keyboard.

In designing this control scheme, my goal was to support a **wide variety of actions** while keeping the controls as **simple and intuitive** as possible. Tap/hold triggers allow a single button to support multiple actions in a way that is, hopefully, easy for the player to remember and execute. For accessibility purposes, the hold time threshold for these controls could be made customizable by the player.

### Gamepad Controls

### Mouse/Keyboard Controls

<div class="tables-container">

| Input | Action |
| -------- | ------- |
| **W/A/S/D** | Walk/Run |
| **Shift** | Sprint |
| **Mouse-X/Y** | Adjust Camera |
| **X** | Melee Attack |
| **Spacebar** | Jump |
| **C** | Crouch |
| **E** | Interact |
| **R (tap)** | Reload |
| **R (hold)** | Open Special Ability Wheel |
| **Escape** | Pause Game |

| Input | Action |
| -------- | ------- |
| **RMB** | Aim Down Sights |
| **RMB + F** | Aim Grenade |
| **Command** | Special Ability |
| **LMB** | Fire Weapon/Throw Grenade |
| **1** | Switch to Squad Member 1 |
| **2** | Switch to Squad Member 2 |
| **3** | Primary Weapon |
| **4** | Secondary Weapon |
| **5 (tap)** | Quick Info |
| **5 (hold)** | Switch Camera Mode |

## Camera

Although the game is designed to be an FPS, I wanted to practice working with different camera systems, so I implemented a camera that can switch between **first-person and third-person (over-the-shoulder) modes**.

[VIDEO TODO]

To simultaneously support first-person and third-person perspectives, I used a separate first-person (“arms only”) and third-person skeletal mesh for each playable character. I shared animations between these meshes by creating an **IK Retargeter** for each mesh in Unreal Engine and retargeting animations between meshes.

<img alt="A screenshot of an IK Retargeter in Unreal Engine showcasing two different skeletal meshes arranged in similar T-poses." src="/images/projects/fps-prototype/ik-retargeting.png" width="700" />

## Sprint Ability

I implemented sprinting using Unreal Engine’s **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**. This allowed me to easily integrate cost and cooldown capabilities to build out a stamina regeneration mechanic.

  # Asset Credits

  To speed up development and allow myself to focus on design and coding, I utilized premade assets from these sources:
  
  - TODO

## Overview

Inspired by the story-driven campaigns of games like _Titanfall 2_ and _Uncharted_, the weapon systems of games like _Halo_ and _Call of Duty_, and the companion mechanics of games like _Mass Effect_ and _Gears of War_, I created this project to practice the design and implementation of various interconnecting game systems and mechanics.

## Controls

Using Unreal Engine 5’s Enhanced Input system, I implemented the game’s controls for both gamepads and mouse/keyboard.

In designing this control scheme, my goal was to support a **wide variety of actions** while keeping the controls as **simple and intuitive** as possible. Tap/hold triggers allow a single button to support multiple actions in a way that is, hopefully, easy for the player to remember and execute. For accessibility purposes, the hold time threshold for these controls could be made customizable by the player.

<div class="flexbox-vertical note">
_Form Family: Graduation_ was the first game I designed and built end to end,
and it was (in some ways) as much an experiment as it was a game.
In addition to practicing skills across the game development pipeline, I wanted to answer these two questions:

- Could I build **engaging levels** containing interesting obstacles and puzzles using only basic 3D forms?
- Could I craft an **emotionally rich story** starring such a strange and simple cast of characters?

Creating _Form Family: Graduation_ was my attempt to find out.
</div>

## Vision

_Form Family: Graduation_ is a wholesome 3D platformer set in a fantasy world where
every character and level is made up of only one type of basic 3D form (cubes, pyramids, cylinders, etc.).

Inspired by the bright environments and joyful sense of movement
offered by classic 3D platform games like _Super Mario 64_
and featuring a family-friendly story that explores serious themes surrounding growing up and loss,
_Form Family: Graduation_ is a unique experience ideal for players 10 and older
who have a fondness for inventive platforming.

### Design Pillars

- Delightfully novel platforming that is challenging yet accessible
- A wholesome and emotionally rich story

## Story

The hero of our story is Sphere, the youngest member of their family
(none of the characters in this game have a canonical gender).
Sphere’s older siblings are Cube, Pyramid, and Cylinder.

Our story begins on the day of Sphere’s graduation from high school.
Sphere wakes up to find that their siblings have prepared a special graduation present
to celebrate Sphere’s growing up and eventually leaving home to find their place in the world:
an obstacle course with one level created by each of the siblings.

Sphere is fearful of the idea of leaving their home and family,
but as Sphere overcomes the challenges set for them by Cube, Pyramid, and Cylinder—and
learns important lessons from each of them along the way—Sphere
finds a courage, resilience, and resourcefulness inside themself that they never realized they had.

- The player encounters a new area, assesses its affordances, and does what is needed to progress.

#### Secondary

- Sphere discovers their next objective in the hub world and then achieves it.
- Sphere enters a level, navigates through it, and then completes the level end goal.
- Sphere gathers all the required items in a level.
- Sphere completes a collection of collectible items, triggering an optional addition to the story.
- The player experiences a meaningful advancement in the story.

#### Tertiary

### Mechanics

<div class="flexbox-vertical note">
  In designing the mechanics of this game, I wanted to strike a balance between accessibility and challenge
  in addition to giving the player a clear sense of progression.

  Sphere starts the game with only the most basic movement mechanic: rolling.
  As the game progresses, Sphere learns more complex moves and how to combine and chain moves
  to perform increasingly impressive feats.

### Mechanics

<div class="flexbox-vertical note">
In designing the mechanics of this game, I wanted to strike a balance between accessibility and challenge
in addition to giving the player a clear sense of progression.

Sphere starts the game with only the most basic movement mechanic: rolling.
As the game progresses, Sphere learns more complex moves and how to combine and chain moves
to perform increasingly impressive feats.
